PIN! Borns as the nexus between
the user and the different activities that 
Montevideo has to offer. Due to the insufficient
diffusion of events, entertainment spaces and 
gastronomic offers, we decided to create a site
that gathers as much information as possible,
in order to give the user a unique place where
to find a wide variety of options.

## Usage
New user:
- A new user must register on the website and then log in. When entering the website you will see a main carousel with some events. Clicking on any of them will display information about the event.

- In case you want to see the available categories the user must enter the "categories" section located in the menu at the top left. As in the main page you can see a carousel with all the categories and choose the one that best suits your needs. Within each category you will be able to see all available events.

## Related Projects
- In the local market there is only one project similar to PIN! It was launched a few months ago and its name is VOY. It is an application that like us offers a wide variety of events, with the difference that PIN offers the user a greater and more detailed description of the events.
